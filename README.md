If you're a power-user, upload a bunch of tweets from your desktop or GoogleDrive: Just follow the guidelines describing the creation of a tweet-table or clone the predefined GoogleDrive Spreadsheet, input your data and import the file - et voil√†!

Further, autoChirp empowers you to fit more content into your tweets by providing the possibility to automagically convert your longer-than-280-character-tweets into an image.


## Employed technologies
This application is build upon the Spring MVC framework (with its Spring Social Twitter module) and uses Thymeleaf as templating-engine while custom styles are written in SASS. Behind the scenes Heideltime and the TreeTagger dig through Wikipedia-articles to find parsable dates and extract those.
